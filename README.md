[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Adds a **MISSILE CAMERA** page to [NOXMFD](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD)'s browser MFD — live seeker MJPEG, HUD markers, telemetry, and remote-piloting controls for missiles under [MissileCamera Remote Control](https://github.com/Mursisru/MissileCamera-Remote-Control).

Built entirely through NOXMFD's public extension API (`NOXMFD.Api`, see [`EXTENSIONS.md`](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD/blob/main/EXTENSIONS.md)). This repo does **not** modify NOXMFD's source.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Install order:** BepInEx 5 → [MissileCamera](https://github.com/Mursisru/MissileCamera) → [MissileCamera: Remote Control](https://github.com/Mursisru/MissileCamera-Remote-Control) → [NOXMFD](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD) (≥ 0.23.0) → **`NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera.dll`**.

## Features

- **Live seeker MJPEG** at `/ext/rc-missile-camera/feed.mjpg` (only while this page is visible).
- **Headless bridge capture** — drives MissileCamera `McBridge.RequestCapture` so the feed works without cockpit fullscreen (`K`).
- **RC commands** — aim drag, TAKE / RELEASE, throttle nudge, **AB click-toggle**, formation, vision cycle, manual detonate (hold), missile pool picker.
- **Telemetry overlay** — speed, alt, range, fuel, guidance, TTI; CombatHUD unit markers with configurable name labels (via MC bridge cfg).
- **Tab isolation** — MJPEG pauses when you leave the MISSILE CAMERA page so RC does not leak onto MAP / WPN / other NOXMFD tabs.

---

## What's here

Mirrors NOXMFD's own `src/plugin` + `src/web` split.

- `src/plugin/Plugin.cs`, `MissileCameraLifecycle.cs`, `MissileCameraCommands.cs`, `MissileCameraTelemetry.cs`, `MissileCameraAssets.cs` — BepInEx plugin.
- `src/plugin/McBridge.cs`, `RcBridge.cs`, `RcFeed.cs` — reflection soft-deps on MissileCamera and MissileCamera Remote Control (neither mod references this extension).
- `src/web/missile-camera.html`, `missile-camera.css`, `missile-camera.js` — MFD page UI; commands POST to `/ext/rc-missile-camera/command`.
- `lib/NOXMFD.dll` — compile-time reference only (not shipped to players).

---

## Using the page

1. Launch a player-owned missile (same rules as MissileCamera / RC).
2. In NOXMFD, open **EXT → MISSILE CAMERA** (exact nav label depends on your NOXMFD layout).
3. Press **TAKE** to remote-control (requires RC installed and a controllable RC clone unless `AllowAnyMunition` is on).
4. Drag on the feed to aim; use **AB** (toggle), throttle buttons, **FORM**, **VIS**, **DETONATE** (hold) as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Cockpit fullscreen (`K`) is optional — this page is a full RC surface on its own. With MissileCamera `SuppressCockpitMfd=true` (default), the in-cockpit MFD missile panel hides while this page holds bridge capture.

> [!NOTE]
> **Preview-only mode:** if RC is missing or not ready, the page may still show the seeker feed but disables TAKE / control buttons.

---

## Configuration

This extension has **no separate `.cfg` file**. It reads MissileCamera bridge tuning via reflection:

| MissileCamera `[MissileCameraBridge]` key | Effect on this page |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Enabled` | Master bridge allow |
| `FeedWidth` / `FeedHeight` | Seeker render aspect (default **960×540**) |
| `StreamHz` / `StreamMaxDim` / `StreamJpegQuality` | MJPEG capture rate and size |
| `MarkerLabels` | `All` / `SelectedOnly` / `None` for HUD name tags |
| `SuppressCockpitMfd` | Hide duplicate cockpit MFD feed while this page is open |
| `TelemetryInterval` / `MarkersInterval` / `PoolInterval` | Browser update rates |

Edit in MissileCamera's Configuration Manager or `BepInEx/config/com.at747.missilecamera.bepinex.cfg`. See the [MissileCamera README — MissileCameraBridge](https://github.com/Mursisru/MissileCamera#missilecamerabridge).

---

## Building

Requires the .NET SDK and a Nuclear Option install with BepInEx 5 + NOXMFD already present.

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

If your game is not at the default Steam path, create a local `GameDir.props` next to `RcMissileCamera.csproj` (gitignored):

```xml
<Project><PropertyGroup>
  <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option</GameDir>
</PropertyGroup></Project>
```

Release build copies `NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera.dll` to `<GameDir>\BepInEx\plugins`.

---

## Installing

1. Install **NOXMFD** (≥ 0.23.0), **MissileCamera**, and **MissileCamera Remote Control**.
2. Drop **`NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera.dll`** into `BepInEx/plugins/`. Do **not** copy `lib/NOXMFD.dll` — NOXMFD already loads it.
3. Launch the game. **MISSILE CAMERA** appears under NOXMFD's EXT nav automatically.

---

## Updating `lib/NOXMFD.dll`

Replace `lib/NOXMFD.dll` with a fresh build from [NOXMFD](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD) when the `Api` surface changes so this project still compiles.

---

## Cutting a release

- Tag = bare semver (`0.1.0`, not `v0.1.0`). Match `<Version>` in `RcMissileCamera.csproj`.
- Full release only (no `--prerelease`).
- Title: `NOXMFD: RC Missile Camera Extension X.Y.Z`.
- Attach `NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera_X.Y.Z.zip` containing `NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera/NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera.dll`.

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
gh release create X.Y.Z --title "NOXMFD: RC Missile Camera Extension X.Y.Z" --notes-file CHANGELOG.md NOXMFD.RcMissileCamera_X.Y.Z.zip
```

- **[Mursisru](https://github.com/Mursisru)** — this extension, MissileCamera, and MissileCamera: Remote Control
- **[roke77](https://github.com/roke77)** — [NOXMFD](https://github.com/roke77/NOXMFD) host and extension API
- **[lupfine](https://github.com/lupfine)** — original remote-camera / Bridge integration design

The Bridge APIs on the MissileCamera and RC side were shaped for external MFD consumers; this repo is a standalone fork of that integration so it ships on its own release cycle instead of living inside NOXMFD's tree.
